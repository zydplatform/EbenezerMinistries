== Installation ==

**How to create your own free livestream with Hapity**

1. **Create Your Free Hapity Account:** To get started, create your free Hapity account. [Go to the registration page](https://www.hapity.com/register?utm_source=wordpressorg) and enter your desired login credentials. Or you can also sign in with Facebook or Twitter.

2. **Install and Activate your Free Hapity Plugin:** The Hapity plugin is available for free, here on WordPress.org. You can download using the link above, or install it directly from your WordPress dashboard. To do that, go to **Plugins** → **Add New** in your WordPress dashboard. Then, search for **"Hapity"** and click the Install Now button. Then, Activate.

3. In order to connect your Hapity account to the plugin on your WordPress site, you'll use something called an "Auth ID" to link the two together. To find your Auth ID, log in to your Hapity account and click on Settings in the top-right corner.

4. **Find and paste your Plugin ID:** Then, scroll down and find the box for Plugin ID, which contains a long string of numbers and letters. Once you've copied the Plugin ID, go to your WordPress site's dashboard and click on the Hapity option in your WordPress dashboard sidebar. 

Then, paste the Plugin ID into the box labeled **Enter Your Auth ID** and click the Authenticate button. Once you activate the plugin, you should see a new set of options. By default, Hapity is Enabled as soon as you authenticate your Auth ID.

5. **Broadcast your first livestream**: Now you're ready to broadcast your first livestream!

Before you begin, you can give your broadcast an optional name and configure other basic options. If you want to automatically add your free livestream to your WordPress website, you should check the box for **Embed into website**.

You can share your broadcast before or after on social media by selecting the appropriate icons; the first time you use these, you’ll be asked to log in. You can also share on other platforms including email, SMS, and Whatsapp. 

If using a mobile device, your broadcast will be saved onto your device (find this under **Gallery** on Android, and **Photos** on iPhone).
